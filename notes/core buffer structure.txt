buffers that i want to read
    bram output
    hash a -> h (optional for now honestly)

buffers that i want to write
    bram input
    bram address
    hash input buffers (2 driven from RAM)
    msa input buffers (4 driven from RAM)

could make BRAM centric
    processor only reads/writes bram related buffers
    buffer_sel can then shuffle bram reads to selected buffer
                                selected buffer to bram writes
